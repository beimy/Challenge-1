This site is a mock up of a real world buisness website. It's code was not up to industry standards when it came to accessibility, my aim is to fix that.

The main issues were as follows:

1. HTML elements didn't make use of semantic elements, limiting readability and accessiblility.

2. Some broken links caused by undeclared id's.

3. Lack of alt text for images.

4. Disjointed placement of css code styles.

5. Non-discriptive title.

6. CSS styles were repeated often and could be consolidated.
